  abstract  = {We present a new transition system with word reordering for unrestricted non-
	projective dependency parsing. Our system is based on decomposed arc-eager
	rather than arc-standard, which allows more flexible ambiguity resolution
	between a local projective and non-local crossing attachment. In our experiment
	on Universal Dependencies 2.0, we find our parser outperforms the ordinary
	swap-based parser particularly on languages with a large amount of
	non-projectivity.},
