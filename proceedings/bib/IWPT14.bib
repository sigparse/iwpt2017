  abstract  = {In this paper, we extend the arc-hybrid system for transition-based parsing
	with a swap transition that enables reordering of the words and construction of
	non-projective trees. Although this extension breaks the arc-decomposability of
	the transition system, we show how the existing dynamic oracle for this system
	can be modified and combined with a static oracle only for the swap transition.
	Experiments on 5 languages show that the new system gives competitive accuracy
	and is significantly better than a system trained with a purely static oracle.},
