  abstract  = {Syntactic annotation is costly and not available for the vast majority of the
	world's languages. We show that sometimes we can do away with less labeled data
	by exploiting more readily available forms of mark-up. Specifically, we revisit
	an idea from Valentin Spitkovsky's work (2010), namely that hyperlinks
	typically bracket syntactic constituents or chunks. We strengthen his results
	by showing that not only can hyperlinks help in low resource scenarios,
	exemplified here by Quechua, but learning from hyperlinks can also improve
	state-of-the-art NLP models for English newswire. We also present out-of-domain
	evaluation on English Ontonotes 4.0.},
