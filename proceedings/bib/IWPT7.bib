  abstract  = {This paper applies parsing technology to the task of syntactic simplification
	of English sentences, focusing on the identification of text spans that can be
	removed from a complex sentence.  We report the most comprehensive evaluation
	to-date on this task, using a dataset of sentences that exhibit simplification
	based on coordination, subordination, punctuation/parataxis, adjectival
	clauses, participial phrases, and appositive phrases.  We train a decision tree
	with features derived from text span length, POS tags and dependency relations,
	and show that it significantly outperforms a parser-only baseline.},
