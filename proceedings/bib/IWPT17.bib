  abstract  = {We generalize coarse-to-fine parsing to grammar formalisms that are more
	expressive than PCFGs and/or describe languages of trees or graphs. We evaluate
	our algorithm on PCFG, PTAG, and graph parsing. While we achieve the expected
	performance gains on PCFGs, coarse-to-fine does not help for PTAG and can even
	slow down parsing for graphs. We discuss the implications of this finding.},
