  abstract  = {Neural part-of-speech tagging has achieved competitive results with the
	incorporation of character-based and pre-trained word embeddings. In this
	paper, we show that a state-of-the-art bi-LSTM tagger can benefit from using
	information from morphosyntactic lexicons as additional input. The tagger,
	trained on several dozen languages, shows a consistent, average improvement
	when using lexical information, even when also using character-based
	embeddings, thus showing the complementarity of the different sources of
	lexical information. The improvements are particularly important for the
	smaller datasets.},
