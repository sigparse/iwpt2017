  abstract  = {This paper presents a joint model for morphological and
	dependency analysis based on automatically acquired lexical
	knowledge. This model takes advantage of rich lexical knowledge to
	simultaneously resolve word segmentation, POS, and
	dependency ambiguities. In our experiments on Japanese, we show the
	effectiveness of our joint
	model over conventional pipeline models.},
