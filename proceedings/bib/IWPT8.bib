  abstract  = {In applying word-based dependency parsing such as Universal Dependencies (UD)
	to Japanese, the uncertainty of word segmentation emerges for defining
	a word unit of the dependencies.
	We introduce the following  hierarchical word structures to
	dependency parsing in Japanese:
	morphological units (a short unit word, SUW) and
	syntactic units (a long unit word, LUW).
	An SUW can be used to segment a sentence consistently, 
	while it is too short to represent syntactic construction.
	An LUW is a unit including functional multiwords and 
	LUW-based analysis facilitates the capturing of syntactic structure
	and makes parsing results more precise than SUW-based analysis.
	This paper describes the results of a feasibility study on
	the ability and the effectiveness of parsing methods
	based on hierarchical word structure (LUW chunking$+$parsing)
	in comparison to single layer word structure (SUW parsing).
	We also show joint analysis of LUW-chunking and dependency parsing 
	improves the performance of identifying predicate-argument structures,
	while there is not much difference between overall results of them. not much
	difference between overall results of them.},
