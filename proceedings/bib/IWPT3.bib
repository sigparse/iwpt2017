  abstract  = {We present a systematic analysis of lexicalized vs. delexicalized parsing in
	low-resource scenarios, and propose a methodology to choose one method over
	another under certain conditions. We create a set of simulation experiments on
	41 languages and apply our findings to 9 low-resource languages. Experimental
	results show that our methodology chooses the best approach in 8 out of 9
	cases.},
