  abstract  = {To improve grammatical function labelling for German, we augment the labelling
	component of a neural dependency parser with a decision history. We present
	different ways to encode the history, using different LSTM architectures, and
	show that our models yield significant improvements, resulting in a LAS for
	German that is close to the best result from the SPMRL 2014 shared task
	(without the reranker).},
